Sprint Planning Meeting - Q4 2024
Date: October 15, 2024
Participants: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana

Alice: Okay everyone, let's start the sprint planning. We need to decide on our priorities for the next two weeks.

Bob: I think we should focus on the authentication module first. It's blocking other features.

Charlie: Actually, I agree with Bob. We decided last week that authentication is critical, right?

Alice: Yes, we agreed on that. So authentication module is our top priority.

Diana: What about the database migration? That's also important and Charlie said it might cause issues if we delay.

Charlie: Yes, there is a risk that the database migration could break existing features if we wait too long. Diana, can you handle the migration?

Diana: Sure, I will work on the database migration by next Friday. I'll need Bob to review the schema changes.

Bob: I will review Diana's schema changes and provide feedback by Wednesday.

Alice: Good. So we have two main action items: Diana handles the migration, Bob reviews it. Let's also talk about the API endpoints.

Charlie: We need to implement the user management endpoints. I think we should assign this to someone.

Alice: I will take care of the user management endpoints. I should have them done by the end of next week.

Bob: Sounds good. But we also need to consider the security concerns that were raised last meeting. There's a potential risk with the current authentication flow.

Alice: That's a valid concern. Let's make sure we address that. Bob, can you investigate the security issues?

Bob: Yes, I will investigate the security concerns and report back on Monday.

Alice: Perfect. So to summarize: Authentication module is our top priority, Diana will do the database migration by Friday, Bob will review it by Wednesday, I'll handle the user management API endpoints, and Bob will investigate security concerns by Monday.

All: Agreed.

Alice: Great! Let's wrap up. Next meeting is scheduled for next Monday at 2 PM.
