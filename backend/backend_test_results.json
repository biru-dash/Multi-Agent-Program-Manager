  "summary": "The Q4 Product Launch Planning Meeting is taking place today at 2:30 PM. They are planning the Q4 product launch of their new cloud analytics platform 8 weeks before the launch date. The biggest risk is the Salesforce integration delay, so the board decides to push the launch by 2 weeks to October 29th. Alex, James, Emily, Priya, and Marcus need to update the project plan with the new launch date and revised feature set, coordinate with engineering on the performance testing sprint, update go-to-market plan with revised timeline and gating criteria, and update marketing materials.",
